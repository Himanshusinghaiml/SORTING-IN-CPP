# Sorting_in-_cpp
#Bubble Sort
-> Swap two adjacent element if they are in wrong order .
Time Complexity -> O(N^2)

#Selection Sort -> find the minimum element in unsorted array and Swap it with element at begining .
Selection Sort:

Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2)
Best-case time complexity: O(n^2) because it performs the same number of comparisons regardless of input

#Insertion sort -> insert an element from unsorted array to its correct position  in sorted array .

#merge sort -> based on divide and conquer method .
Time comlexity ->o(NlogN)

#Quick sort-> based on divide and conquer method.
